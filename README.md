# Creation of website for a student-run consulting company (Started)

Started is a consulting startup created by McGill students to provide business-building resources for Montreal-based social entrepreneurs. The goal is to increase entrepreneurs' access to capital through targeted business development. Specifically, Started provides support on impact measurement, the design of a business plan, and helps entrepreneurs connect with investors, incubators, and accelerators. 

I worked as a freelance to build a complete business platform using Wix as the support to this website. Having little prior experience in website design, this project taught me how to construct a professional website with advanced features while strengthening my skills on website builders such as wix or Wordpress.
